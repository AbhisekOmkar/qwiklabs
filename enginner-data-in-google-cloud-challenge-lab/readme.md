# Challenge scenario

You have started a new role as a Data Engineer for TaxiCab Inc. You are expected to import some historical data to a working BigQuery dataset, and build a basic model that predicts fares based on information available when a new ride starts. Leadership is interested in building an app and estimating for users how much a ride will cost. The source data will be provided in your project.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for these tasks, so don't expect step-by-step guides to be provided.
